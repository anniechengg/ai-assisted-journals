Woke up from a strange dream just then â€” I was at the airport and just as I was going through the security line, all of my bags disappeared. I reached into my pocket and my passport was gone too, all of my ID cards were gone. A TSA agent stopped me at the checkpoint and demanded that I show my identification but my hands were empty and I just felt such an immense pit in my stomach. I started pleading with them to let me through to the gate because my flight was departing in thirty minutes and I had to get home, it was urgent, I had to go home, but the agent told me I had to leave the premises. But instead of leaving, I ran past the security line through the metal detector, and all the metal detectors started blaring with alarm bells because, as I looked down, my feet had turned into blocks of metal, and it was so heavy. I kept running and running and all I could hear was the ridiculous plodding of my heavy metal feet on the airport linoleum. The TSA agents started chasing me down the hallway toward the departure gate and I was getting so exhausted from running with my giant metal feet. Woke up before I found out whether I had missed my flight or not.
