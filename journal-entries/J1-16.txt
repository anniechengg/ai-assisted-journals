It’s surreal to be back in the city, back in my tiny apartment. Everything is how I left it but the dimensions of my life always seem so different after some time away. My roommate Clare left a note on my door saying that we’ve been having issues with the heating system in our apartment. She told me that I should call the electrician and sort it out because she’ll be gone for the weekend on a trip. This really frustrated me because Clare is always doing this—she never takes the initiative to solve issues in our apartment herself. She’ll just point them out and expect me or Riley to sort out all the logistics and inconveniences while she goes off on all of her trips and getaways with her extremely wealthy family… it’s whatever. I’ve been having so many issues with Clare these days and I was honestly so glad for the few weeks away at home to have a break from all the roommate drama. Riley, Clare, Jo, and I were all friends before moving in together, but I guess it’s somewhat true that you should never live with your friends. Being in such close proximity to both of them has just drawn out a lot of tensions and differences between us. Like the fact that Clare has clearly never fixed anything herself and just expects everyone else to do it for her. Or the fact that Riley will never communicate about bringing their partner and their friends into the apartment, and so I’ll come home and there will be so many people crowded into the living room making so much noise. Or Jo’s passive aggressive texts about cleaning the bathroom. I guess it’s all part of being in your 20s and having to live with roommates and just dealing with it, but sometimes I get so fed up with it and can’t stand being in my own space because I just feel so claustrophobic.
