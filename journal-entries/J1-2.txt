I finally responded to Emily’s text today, after having given myself some time to process it. I found myself getting paralyzed by how to phrase this or that, and I just had to force myself to press send. 

I guess it’s complex in all types of relationships but sometimes it’s especially hard not to feel a bit trapped with family because they’ve known you for so long, they know all the undignified and ugly parts of you along with all the good, and there’s a sense of collective duty that just makes everything so much more messily intertwined. Emily, for instance: I’ve seen so many parts of her as we’ve grown up. I’ve seen her when she was shy and socially insecure in high school, and in those times, we fought a lot because she was jealous that I had more friends than her, but also jealous of my friends for taking up so much of my time. I’ve seen her when she left home for college and she changed a lot, when she had that whole phase of cutting off contact with Mom and Dad, and we were all so worried about her. I remember back then that she would send me long emails about how troubled she felt about herself, how she felt lost and lonely. And while I don’t wish that phase upon her again at all, I do strangely miss the relationship we had then — because I was a person she trusted, her first point of contact, someone who she could be vulnerable with at a time when she was so unsettled. 

I’m flying home tomorrow; I will need to wake up early, so I’m going to sleep now.
