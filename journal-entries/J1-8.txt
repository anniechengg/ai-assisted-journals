I’m so tired today — it’s been a long day of preparation, a few more high school friends are home for the holidays so I had a lot of socialization today and I need a bit of a break. Made myself some tea. Lying in bed now. Emily is arriving early tomorrow morning, and I’m picking her up from the airport at 6am, so I should really go to sleep early.
