More disturbing dreams tonight. I dreamt that I was in a country very far away from here and I saw on my Instagram news feed that my best friend had died in a field that was on fire. Soon after in the dream, I got a text from my aunt that two of my cousins had drowned in a swimming pool at dawn. The rest of the dream was just me figuring out funeral logistics from afar, trying to text people but they were all asleep. I feel like the symbolism in the dream is pretty in-your-faceâ€”in the sense that I clearly have some level of fear about being far away from home when the people I love are in pain or in difficult situations. I guess this could be immediately linked to Mom's illness, but also to Emily and her stress levels, or to all my friends at home too and their changing life circumstances. Especially since I'm leaving so soon again, my brain must be processing all of these emotions subconsciously.
