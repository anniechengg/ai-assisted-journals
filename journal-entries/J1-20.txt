Dreamt last night that I was in the vestibule of a church, the room right before you enter the sanctuary. I was reading through the tithe envelopes, name after name. The entire church was empty, the lights were off, and so I wandered down the aisle up to the room above where the organ is, and I ran into the pastor. She was packing up her things and telling me about how she doesn’t really believe in any of this, she just sort of fell into this line of work, and she spends day after day writing sermons that she doesn’t think anyone really listens to, and that she wants to retire as soon as possible. Then I was inside the pipes of the church organ and I saw Giovanni staring at me through the pipes from the pews down below. I reached my hand through the pipe and suddenly we were both tiptoeing around the balcony of the church, whispering odd, sacrilegious things. Before leaving the church, we lit a candle for his father who had nearly died last year and for my mom too, and it was altogether really strange since neither of us are religious. That was the end of the dream. I haven’t thought about him in awhile, ever since we lost touch, and maybe we hadn’t really known each other that well to begin with, we just happened to collide in each other’s lives at a very particular place and time.
