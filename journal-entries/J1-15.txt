I’m on the plane right now. The guy next to me is coughing so much and I can’t sleep so I’m typing this out instead. I always get really emotional on the plane leaving home, which is maybe cliche and to be expected, but anyway. Going home always rips the wool off my eyes. In some ways, it makes me fall back into old patterns that I thought I had outgrown, in a way that can be kind of disturbing; and I remember how stifling it can be to live with my family just because we are all so enmeshed in each others’ space and time. In other ways, I remember with clarity the things that keep me grounded and really return me to myself—the liquid amber trees on my street, effortless conversations with my oldest friends who have known and loved every version of me, the taste of the coffee at the shitty coffee shop I’ve gone to ever since I was in high school, how the sky feels so close to the ground. Every time, I think to myself that maybe I should look for jobs closer to home, but then every time, I return to the city anyway, back to my thankless job where I make just enough to pay rent and afford groceries. I don’t know if it’s worth it for a sense of independence over my own life.
