I’m in a grumpy mood today. Jo texted me this morning saying something like “in the future, it’s always good to wash your yogurt containers before recycling them.” Whatever. I’m so sick of them micromanaging every tiny action I make. I constantly feel like I’m doing something wrong around them, just because they are so anal about every detail. It makes it so hard to be in the apartment because I’m afraid to leave a hair anywhere. Literally — I remember them texting me a few months back that they noticed I left a hair on the sink and telling me to clean it up. Am I going crazy, or is that a bit much? On the other hand, though, Riley had a bunch of friends over last night and they were being so loud in the kitchen until nearly 2 in the morning. I barely slept at all and I’ve just been trying to get over this cold… ugh. I don’t mean to be overly harsh about my roommates but I’m actually so fed up with them.
