Kaila is coming to visit me tomorrow, which I’m really excited about. This is the first time she’s come to see me in the city and I think it will be genuinely grounding to be with my best friend from home who knows me so well in this place that can feel so defamiliarizing sometimes. So I spent the day getting ready for her arrival — went to the department store to get an extra set of bedding and an air mattress (this is the first time I’ve really had someone stay with me in the apartment), went to the grocery store to get some ingredients because Kaila and I are planning to make a chocolate chip banana bread as soon as she gets here, and then I did laundry and cleaned my room. Kaila has a really calming effect on me, especially when I’m experiencing moments of intense change. She has talked me through a number of breakups and friendship breakups; she has been consistently there for me during Mom’s illness. Recently, she has been helping me gather the courage to quit my job. I think it’s because Kaila herself is so willing to look at the instability and uncertainty of life with a steady and unwavering gaze that she really encourages me to do the same. She never judges my decisions in a totalizing way, which makes me less prone to do that to myself. Anyway, I’m just really extremely excited for my best friend to be here, I just can’t wait.
