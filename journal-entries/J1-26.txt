Today was a wonderful day. Kaila arrived at 10am and I met her at the train station, we went to get brunch at one of my favorite neighborhood cafes (we got breakfast burritos, as is our tradition), and then we wandered around the park and talked about everything big and small in our lives. We baked the banana bread and delivered it to some of my other friends in the city (I was so excited to introduce them to Kaila—it’s always lovely when old friends get along with new friends). I feel a lot calmer today than I have in a long time, which makes a lot of sense because Kaila is here, and whenever we’re together, we fall into rituals so easily.

Some other random things of note: I’ve drafted the email to quit my job, which I think I’ll send to my manager next week. I’m going to my judo tournament tomorrow (Kaila is coming to watch). Clare is back in the apartment as of today after her long ski trip. I’ve been picking up some night shifts at the library circulation desk and my coworker Abdul is having a lot of chronic back pain—along with his underlying heart condition—which has been making me nervous. I think I might try to deliver groceries for him sometime this week — he is 60 years old and lives alone, given that his family all live abroad. He reminds me a lot of my grandfather who I never really got the chance to be close to before he passed away last year given the language barrier between us. Abdul has a really similar sense of propriety about him; he likes to have things done the right way, and he cares about tradition and duty and being of service to other people. But he and my grandfather also share the same sense of humor, and this is what I really like most about him. Sometimes I feel like connecting with Abdul is a way for me to make up for the guilt I feel about never having been close to any of my grandparents. I wonder if Abdul will retire soon given his health conditions; if so, I would really miss him and all the time we share at the circ desk.
