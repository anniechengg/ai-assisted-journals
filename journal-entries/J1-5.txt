Ate a really good breakfast this morning. Toast with sourdough bread from the local bakery, tomatoes from the backyard garden that Mom has been planting, some yogurt and honey. Black tea. Sat at the kitchen table and read the Sunday newspaper. Going to the park later today to see Kaila for the first time in a while and Iâ€™m quite excited for that because she just told me she has a new boyfriend, and I need to hear all the details.
