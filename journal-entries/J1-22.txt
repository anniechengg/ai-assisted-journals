I don’t have too much to report today; just a lot of work. Every day is blending into the next. I’m feeling a little better this morning, but I’m pretty behind. Finally got the electricity back up and running. Called Mom last night and her latest treatment was tough but she’s recovering ok. According to Mom, Em got a new gig at a church and so she’s less stressed out than usual which is good. I told her about the new job interviews I have lined up. I want to quit my current job so badly because my manager Rebecca is just so insufferable. She’s always making off hand comments about “diversity in the workplace” and usually I wouldn’t be fazed by it but day in and day out, it does get really grating. I remember on my first day of work, she was telling everyone that she wishes they could have hired “another Matt” (since the guy I was replacing was named Matt and he was just this bland white dude) which really set things off on a bad note for me. And all of that aside, she’s so patronizing and so micromanaging that it makes me dread going to work. I don’t want to complain too much but I’m just so exhausted by the end of each day. I’m glad I at least get to work from home a lot of the time so that I don’t have to make small talk with her. I’m friendly with most of my other coworkers but they’re all much older than me, with families and kids, so we don’t have as much to relate to each other about, and their lives are just so different from mine. It can be really isolating and I’m just ready for a change of pace.
