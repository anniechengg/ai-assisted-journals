Slept poorly. A lot of stressful dreams that I don’t remember. Tomorrow is Mom’s birthday and we’re hosting thirty people at home for a dinner party, the first time most of these people have seen her since she got sick last year. It’s gonna be really strange, I think, and it will take a lot of coordination from me and Emily to make sure everything goes smoothly. Em and I had a chat yesterday which was not perfect, but at least we ironed out some of the more trivial differences between us, and I think the peace will last through the birthday dinner party, which is what matters most right now. Mom would be really sad if we spent her birthday fighting, and that would break my heart, and I bet Em feels the same way.
