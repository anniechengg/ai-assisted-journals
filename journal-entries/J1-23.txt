Woke up late today and I was rushing to work (in person work today)—last night, I dreamt that I was in the laundromat and for some reason, I swallowed a cup of laundry detergent. There was genuinely no cause or effect from the laundry detergent (I mean, I don’t think it tasted very good, but I managed to swallow the whole thing). It was electric blue and very artificial-looking. Anyway, I woke up late and was rushing to get on the train to work. There was a signal malfunction at one of the stations on my train line, so we were stalled for fifteen minutes. Chatted with the girl next to me on the train; I was reading a book, and she had read the same book a month ago, and she told me that the book starts to get really good on page 75, so don’t give up, you have to get to page 75. This reminded me why I do love the city, these moments of intense coincidence and urban communion. Even the inconvenience of a train delay and a convoluted commute is offset by the randomness of striking up conversation with someone on the train and having a moment of genuine connection before going about your respective lives again.
