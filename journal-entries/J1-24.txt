Busy day at work today — not much to say about that, there wasn’t really anything memorable. I feel like I’ve been really living for my hobbies these days because work is so mindless. Ever since starting the martial arts around a year ago, I can’t go a week without it. I love learning how my body reacts to gravity and the weight of another person; it has taught me a lot about how to approach confrontation and conflict. I used to be a lot more conflict averse, but now that I have thrown people to the ground and been thrown on the ground myself so many times, I find myself much more willing to engage in argument with other people as something collaborative (not necessarily antagonistic), in the sense that if you enter an argument with good faith, you will always learn something and hopefully the other person learns something too. Today I was paired with Amira and we were practicing shoulder throws. It was so cool to experiment with speed and directionality; for instance, if you quickly pull the other person in a circular motion, and then turn your back toward them, they will naturally fall onto your back and it becomes extremely easy to throw them. Lots to think about and practice before the tournament this week!
