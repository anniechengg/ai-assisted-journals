Kaila wanted me to meet her new boyfriend today so we went to a coffee shop and spent a few hours chatting. To be honest… I really didn’t like him? I mean, Kaila is gorgeous and hilarious and full of life and she is an incredibly accomplished artist (her paintings have gone up in major galleries, like, hello??) and she has so many cool hobbies and interests and is an absolute joy of a human being. This dude Oliver.. I guess there’s nothing horribly wrong with him, other than that he is so pathetic and mediocre, especially compared to Kaila. He’s older than us by several years but he still has no real job, he seems to have no ambitions or dreams, and he is just so painfully bland to talk to. I have no idea why Kaila is dating him, but I guess to each their own? Kaila asked me what I thought of Oliver and I didn’t know how to respond… I obviously didn’t want to lie and pretend that I really liked him (when I just didn’t get along with him at all), but she was going on and on about how much she is obsessed with him, so I just kind of nodded and said I was happy to see her so happy. I hope they break up though. I feel like I’m being kind of mean, but I just want the best for Kaila and it sucks to see her with someone who doesn’t deserve her at all.
