Woke up last night from a dream that I was on the judo mat but everyone was doing a completely different kind of martial arts style… maybe jiu-jitsu or aikido? The throws were completely different and I had no idea what the rules were other than that there was a lot more punching involved than I was used to. You don’t really throw punches in judo. I tried to do a hip throw like I would do in judo and everyone was so perplexed and their bodies didn’t know how to react to it. Later in the dream, I was on the mat sparring with an old friend of mine, Serena, who I haven’t seen in almost a year. (In real life, she’s never done anything martial arts related, to be clear). While we were fighting, she asked me if I wanted to get coffee at the pastry shop we used to frequent when we were in college. It was odd; she told me that they had changed up the recipe for the cardamom buns that I used to love and that really irritated me in the dream because I thought it was a bad idea to change up a recipe that was already perfectly fine.
