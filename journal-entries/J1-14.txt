Today was a busy final day at home. I finished cleaning up my room, packed my bags, and then spent the rest of the day with Mom and Em. We drove to the coast, went to one of our favorite restaurants, and ordered our usual favorites. Then we walked along the beach and we were mostly silent. Both in the moment and right now, I don’t have too much to say even though I’m feeling a lot of things because it’s just been so hectic but I’m sure I’ll have more to reflect on later.
