Still sick—I’m hoping it’s nothing serious because I have a bunch of job interviews lined up in the next few weeks and it would be so stressful to do the interviews while I’m sick. I really need to get better about going to the doctor when I’m experiencing prolonged symptoms but I think I’ve typically been a bit resistant to seeking medical help. Growing up, Mom was pretty against us taking any medications, even painkillers, because she was afraid of the unintended consequences. Even if a doctor prescribed something, she would tell us it’s always better to cure things as naturally as possible. She herself was really afraid of the dentist because of a bad surgery she got one time, and so she hasn’t been to the dentist for almost twenty years. I think about this often.
