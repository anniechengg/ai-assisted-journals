Said goodbye to Kaila today at the train station. Spent the rest of the day job searching but I kept getting distracted and a little demoralized—the whole job search process just feels like throwing yourself into a void… so many jobs have totally ghosted me, other ones have brought me all the way to the last round of interviews but have rejected me at the last moment. Oh well, I guess that’s just how it goes; the economy is really bad, and frankly no one I know is getting jobs, so I know it’s not my fault entirely, but still! I just have to keep getting used to rejection. It doesn’t really get better though… and it’s hard not to take it personally. 

Went to my night shift at the library; chatted with Abdul for a while about his most recent medical appointment for his back pain. He’s in better spirits about it, but I think he’s mostly just trying to put mind over matter. I brought him some fruit and tea, like Mom used to do for our neighbor Mr. Lee when he got sick. Over the four years that we’ve worked together, Abdul has always brought me random food, snacks, treats… he really likes pistachios and we’d always snack on a huge box of them at the circ desk. I feel like it is long-overdue that I pay it forward to him and take care of him now.
