Woke up really late today after all the festivities yesterday. Ate breakfast. Em was playing the piano all morning and I remembered just how talented she is. Reminds me of all the times in high school when Em would play piano all the time because she wanted to get really good, and after a while, I could tell her mood based on the types of pieces she would play and the manner in which she would play them. Today she was playing some songs that sounded very familiar to me, as if I’d heard them in another lifetime. Her playing was soft and lilting and slow, and it brought me such a sense of peace. I once again feel prematurely homesick, even though I’m here at home right now and Em is still playing the piano and Mom is in the kitchen reading a book and I’m writing this while lying down on my childhood bed.
