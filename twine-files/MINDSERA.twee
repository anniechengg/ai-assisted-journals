I'd like for this mind to reference specific instances within William Shakespeare's plays (comedies, tragedies, histories), sonnets, and other writings in order to connect what I'm saying to broader themes about the complexities of the human condition. Shakespeare was known for his word play and witticisms — it would be great for this mind to draw upon that too. This mind could also reflect on some of the themes that come up in the notion of performance and performativity.

Yesterday, I was talking to Emily on the phone for the first time in a few weeks. Calling her on the phone always leaves me a little worse for wear because it dredges up things that I don’t really want to remember  — old fights, childhood anxieties, parts of her personality that I just can’t stand sometimes, her critiques of me that sting more because she has known me literally since I was born — and yesterday was no exception. Emily was asking me when I was planning to come home for the holidays to visit our parents. She has always been way more anal about planning and details than I am, and because of this, calls where we have to plan anything (a trip, a joint gift for our parents, medical care, etc etc)  always amplify the negativity between us. ''The more we talked, the more accusatory she became about the fact that I haven’t been home in awhile. It just made me feel bad, especially because I know that she is right — I really should be making more of an effort to stay connected to our parents. '' [[See AI interpretation for selected text->Stoicism-1.1]] My gut told me that I should end the call early, even though we hadn’t finished planning my trip. I felt that the longer we stayed on the call, the more likely one of us was to say something that we would really regret. I just told Emily that I could not handle talking to her that afternoon, and that the call was making me feel upset and overwhelmed, and then I hung up. 

''After I hung up, I did feel pretty bad about it because I had ended it rather abruptly and I felt like I hadn’t communicated my feelings very effectively, nor had I really given her the chance to explain herself.'' [[See AI interpretation for selected text->Stoicism-1.2]]  I could tell that Emily was upset at me because she sent me a really long text afterward continuing to berate me for being irresponsible and selfish. I haven’t responded to it yet because even just looking at the message makes me really upset.'' I want to apologize to her but I feel my pride getting in the way because I don’t want to concede to critiques that I find unfairly mean-spirited.''[[See AI interpretation for selected text->Stoicism-1.3]] I don’t know, though, I think I really need to do something different when it comes to my relationship with her. Maybe we need a longer period of not talking? But it’s kind of hard to avoid with mom’s illness; we have no choice but to cooperate with each other, it’s just hard to navigate without building so much resentment. I guess we’ll see how things go for mom’s birthday next month.

''Slept poorly. A lot of stressful dreams that I don’t remember.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-10.1]] Tomorrow is Mom’s birthday and we’re hosting thirty people at home for a dinner party, the first time most of these people have seen her since she got sick last year. It’s gonna be really strange, I think, and it will take a lot of coordination from me and Emily to make sure everything goes smoothly. Em and I had a chat yesterday which was not perfect, but at least we ironed out some of the more trivial differences between us, and I think the peace will last through the birthday dinner party, which is what matters most right now. Mom would be really sad if we spent her birthday fighting, and that would break my heart, and I bet Em feels the same way.

It’s almost midnight now; the dinner party was super stressful but it was a success. I don’t think I realized how much pressure I was putting on myself for this to go perfectly. I guess that it’s because of a lot of things. ''For one, I think I’ve been displacing a lot of my guilt about being so far away from home onto making Mom’s birthday perfect.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-11.1]]  I haven’t been able to provide as much direct care to her as I would have wanted to throughout the past year. Haven’t been able to drive her to her doctor’s appointments or cook food for her or distract her from the more painful parts of her treatment. ''So maybe I’ve been waiting for a day like her birthday to make up for it, to show her that I really care about her, that I’m not a negligent daughter, and that I am always thinking about her — essentially just trying my best to make her feel loved, in case she ever doubted it.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-11.2]] Another thing, I think, that contributed to how much pressure I felt about this party was that so few of our family friends have really seen her since she got sick last year. I could tell that Mom herself was really anxious about this. Obviously she was overjoyed to see so many people, but I think she was also really self-conscious about being weaker than they’ve ever seen her before. She’s always been someone that other people rely on, almost to a fault, and I think she’s not used to being dependent on other people. And she had always prided herself on her almost superhuman levels of energy, how she can pull an all nighter making lesson plans and then show up bright and early in the morning to her first grade elementary classroom, with twenty rowdy kids demanding her attention, and then organize a surprise party for her friends, and then come home and talk to me and Em about our days. I guess my point is, this illness has been such a huge shift in Mom’s self-conception, and all of our relationships with her, and it feels like this dinner party was one of the first times that it’s all come to a head a bit — with all her old friends there, and me and Em both home at the same time for the first time in what feels like forever. I don’t really know what to make of it, but I was really overcome with emotion all evening.

Woke up really late today after all the festivities yesterday. Ate breakfast. ''Em was playing the piano all morning and I remembered just how talented she is. Reminds me of all the times in high school when Em would play piano all the time because she wanted to get really good, and after a while, I could tell her mood based on the types of pieces she would play and the manner in which she would play them.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-12.1]] Today she was playing some songs that sounded very familiar to me, as if I’d heard them in another lifetime. Her playing was soft and lilting and slow, and it brought me such a sense of peace. ''I once again feel prematurely homesick, even though I’m here at home right now and Em is still playing the piano and Mom is in the kitchen reading a book and I’m writing this while lying down on my childhood bed.''

More disturbing dreams tonight. I dreamt that I was in a country very far away from here and I saw on my Instagram news feed that my best friend had died in a field that was on fire. Soon after in the dream, I got a text from my aunt that two of my cousins had drowned in a swimming pool at dawn. The rest of the dream was just me figuring out funeral logistics from afar, trying to text people but they were all asleep. ''I feel like the symbolism in the dream is pretty in-your-face—in the sense that I clearly have some level of fear about being far away from home when the people I love are in pain or in difficult situations. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-13.1]] I guess this could be immediately linked to Mom's illness, but also to Emily and her stress levels, or to all my friends at home too and their changing life circumstances. Especially since I'm leaving so soon again, my brain must be processing all of these emotions subconsciously.

Today was a busy final day at home.'' I finished cleaning up my room, packed my bags, and then spent the rest of the day with Mom and Em.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-14.1]] We drove to the coast, went to one of our favorite restaurants, and ordered our usual favorites. Then we walked along the beach and we were mostly silent. Both in the moment and right now, I don’t have too much to say even though I’m feeling a lot of things because it’s just been so hectic but I’m sure I’ll have more to reflect on later.

I’m on the plane right now. The guy next to me is coughing so much and I can’t sleep so I’m typing this out instead. I always get really emotional on the plane leaving home, which is maybe cliche and to be expected, but anyway. ''Going home always rips the wool off my eyes. In some ways, it makes me fall back into old patterns that I thought I had outgrown, in a way that can be kind of disturbing; and I remember how stifling it can be to live with my family just because we are all so enmeshed in each others’ space and time.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-15.1]] ''In other ways, I remember with clarity the things that keep me grounded and really return me to myself—the liquid amber trees on my street, effortless conversations with my oldest friends who have known and loved every version of me, the taste of the coffee at the shitty coffee shop I’ve gone to ever since I was in high school, how the sky feels so close to the ground.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-15.2]] Every time, I think to myself that maybe I should look for jobs closer to home, but then every time, I return to the city anyway, back to my thankless job where I make just enough to pay rent and afford groceries. I don’t know if it’s worth it for a sense of independence over my own life.

It’s surreal to be back in the city, back in my tiny apartment. ''Everything is how I left it but the dimensions of my life always seem so different after some time away. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-16.1]] My roommate Clare left a note on my door saying that we’ve been having issues with the heating system in our apartment. She told me that I should call the electrician and sort it out because she’ll be gone for the weekend on a trip. This really frustrated me because Clare is always doing this—she never takes the initiative to solve issues in our apartment herself. She’ll just point them out and expect me or Riley to sort out all the logistics and inconveniences while she goes off on all of her trips and getaways with her extremely wealthy family… it’s whatever.'' I’ve been having so many issues with Clare these days and I was honestly so glad for the few weeks away at home to have a break from all the roommate drama.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-16.2]]  Riley, Clare, Jo, and I were all friends before moving in together, but I guess it’s somewhat true that you should never live with your friends. Being in such close proximity to both of them has just drawn out a lot of tensions and differences between us. Like the fact that Clare has clearly never fixed anything herself and just expects everyone else to do it for her. Or the fact that Riley will never communicate about bringing their partner and their friends into the apartment, and so I’ll come home and there will be so many people crowded into the living room making so much noise. Or Jo’s passive aggressive texts about cleaning the bathroom. I guess it’s all part of being in your 20s and having to live with roommates and just dealing with it, but sometimes I get so fed up with it and can’t stand being in my own space because I just feel so claustrophobic.

I think I might be getting sick, maybe from that guy next to me who was coughing so much on the plane next to me. ''My chest hurts a lot and I’m getting a really bad headache and my entire body feels congested. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-17.1]] Didn’t sleep too well last night either.

''Today was calm, since I really want to recover from my cold (I’m more congested today than yesterday, so I took some medication and now at least I’m not coughing as much). '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-18.1]] I called Kaila while I was cooking soup for dinner and it was so good to catch up with her. She’s been stressed out about applying for grad school, but I just know that her art is so fabulous that she’ll get in everywhere she wants to go. She listened to me vent about my roommates (while I whispered in the kitchen so that they couldn’t hear me). I’m just really grateful for her consistent presence in my life. ''I told her my true thoughts on Oliver and I assured her that I will support her no matter what, but as a friend, I also have the responsibility to be honest.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selectec text->Shakespeare-18.2]]  She listened to me wholeheartedly and told me she understands a lot of my concerns. Apparently Oliver is always asking Kaila’s ex Charlie, prying about their past relationship and whether or not Kaila still texts them. No matter how often Kaila tells him that they don’t talk, Oliver still acts so suspicious. ''He even tries to go through her phone sometimes to track what she’s doing?! I told her that this sounds so unhealthy to me, and I don’t want her to have to live in a surveillance state around this man.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-18.3]] But at the same time, I’m thinking of something my friend Martin once told me, which was that maturing means that your friends will date people who you hate, and you just have to be okay with it. I guess he’s right… I’ve definitely dated people who my friends have disapproved of, and it isn’t fun, but at the end of the day, ''I feel like we just have to give other people the space to make their own mistakes and grow. And in any case, getting extremely needlessly angry when your friends are doing things you don’t agree with or find strange is no good, really.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-18.4]]  I remember when Jesse broke off their friendship with me because they didn’t agree with me dating Mei… but Jesse couldn’t articulate any real critique of Mei, other than that they thought Mei was “changing” me for the worse. At this stage of life, I feel like it’s so important to let people change—or at least I feel extremely attached to my own fluidity.

Still sick—I’m hoping it’s nothing serious because I have a bunch of job interviews lined up in the next few weeks and it would be so stressful to do the interviews while I’m sick. ''I really need to get better about going to the doctor when I’m experiencing prolonged symptoms but I think I’ve typically been a bit resistant to seeking medical help.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-19.1]] Growing up, Mom was pretty against us taking any medications, even painkillers, because she was afraid of the unintended consequences. Even if a doctor prescribed something, she would tell us it’s always better to cure things as naturally as possible. She herself was really afraid of the dentist because of a bad surgery she got one time, and so she hasn’t been to the dentist for almost twenty years. I think about this often.

I finally responded to Emily’s text today, after having given myself some time to process it. I found myself getting paralyzed by how to phrase this or that, and I just had to force myself to press send. 

I guess it’s complex in all types of relationships but sometimes it’s especially hard not to feel a bit trapped with family because they’ve known you for so long, they know all the undignified and ugly parts of you along with all the good, and there’s a sense of collective duty that just makes everything so much more messily intertwined. Emily, for instance: I’ve seen so many parts of her as we’ve grown up. I’ve seen her when she was shy and socially insecure in high school, and in those times, we fought a lot because she was jealous that I had more friends than her, but also jealous of my friends for taking up so much of my time.'' I’ve seen her when she left home for college and she changed a lot, when she had that whole phase of cutting off contact with Mom and Dad, and we were all so worried about her.''[[See AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-2.1]] I remember back then that she would send me long emails about how troubled she felt about herself, how she felt lost and lonely. And while I don’t wish that phase upon her again at all, ''I do strangely miss the relationship we had then — because I was a person she trusted, her first point of contact, someone who she could be vulnerable with at a time when she was so unsettled.'' [[See AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-2.2]] How different things are now! 

I’m flying home tomorrow; I will need to wake up early, so I’m going to sleep now.

Dreamt last night that I was in the vestibule of a church, the room right before you enter the sanctuary. I was reading through the tithe envelopes, name after name. The entire church was empty, the lights were off, and so I wandered down the aisle up to the room above where the organ is, and I ran into the pastor. She was packing up her things and telling me about how she doesn’t really believe in any of this, she just sort of fell into this line of work, and she spends day after day writing sermons that she doesn’t think anyone really listens to, and that she wants to retire as soon as possible. ''Then I was inside the pipes of the church organ and I saw Giovanni staring at me through the pipes from the pews down below. I reached my hand through the pipe and suddenly we were both tiptoeing around the balcony of the church, whispering odd, sacrilegious things.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-20.1]] ''Before leaving the church, we lit a candle for his father who had nearly died last year in an accident and for my mom too, and it was altogether really strange since neither of us are religious.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-20.2]] That was the end of the dream. I haven’t thought about him in awhile, ever since we lost touch, and maybe we hadn’t really known each other that well to begin with, we just happened to collide in each other’s lives at a very particular place and time.

I’m in a grumpy mood today. Jo texted me this morning saying something like “in the future, it’s always good to wash your yogurt containers before recycling them.” Whatever. I’m so sick of them micromanaging every tiny action I make. ''I constantly feel like I’m doing something wrong around them, just because they are so anal about every detail.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-21.1]] It makes it so hard to be in the apartment because I’m afraid to leave a hair anywhere. Literally — I remember them texting me a few months back that they noticed I left a hair on the sink and telling me to clean it up. Am I going crazy, or is that a bit much? On the other hand, though, Riley had a bunch of friends over last night and they were being so loud in the kitchen until nearly 2 in the morning. I barely slept at all and I’ve just been trying to get over this cold… ugh. I don’t mean to be overly harsh about my roommates but I’m actually so fed up with them.

''I don’t have too much to report today; just a lot of work. Every day is blending into the next.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-22.1]]  I’m feeling a little better this morning, but I’m pretty behind. Finally got the electricity back up and running. Called Mom last night and her latest treatment was tough but she’s recovering ok. According to Mom, Em got a new gig at a church and so she’s less stressed out than usual which is good. I told her about the new job interviews I have lined up. I want to quit my current job so badly because my manager Rebecca is just so insufferable. She’s always making off hand comments about “diversity in the workplace” and usually I wouldn’t be fazed by it but day in and day out, it does get really grating. I remember on my first day of work, she was telling everyone that she wishes they could have hired “another Matt” (since the guy I was replacing was named Matt and he was just this bland white dude) which really set things off on a bad note for me. And all of that aside,'' she’s so patronizing and so micromanaging that it makes me dread going to work. '' [[See the Ai interpretation for the selected text->PM-22.2]] I don’t want to complain too much but I’m just so exhausted by the end of each day. I’m glad I at least get to work from home a lot of the time so that I don’t have to make small talk with her. I’m friendly with most of my other coworkers but they’re all much older than me, with families and kids, so we don’t have as much to relate to each other about, and their lives are just so different from mine.

Woke up late today and I was rushing to work (in person work today)—last night, I dreamt that I was in the laundromat and for some reason, I swallowed a cup of laundry detergent. There was genuinely no cause or effect from the laundry detergent (I mean, I don’t think it tasted very good, but I managed to swallow the whole thing). It was electric blue and very artificial-looking. Anyway, I woke up late and was rushing to get on the train to work. There was a signal malfunction at one of the stations on my train line, so we were stalled for fifteen minutes. Chatted with the girl next to me on the train; I was reading a book, and she had read the same book a month ago, and she told me that the book starts to get really good on page 75, so don’t give up, you have to get to page 75. ''This reminded me why I do love the city, these moments of intense coincidence and urban communion. Even the inconvenience of a train delay and a convoluted commute is offset by the randomness of striking up conversation with someone on the train and having a moment of genuine connection before going about your respective lives again.''

Busy day at work today — not much to say about that, there wasn’t really anything memorable. I feel like I’ve been really living for my hobbies these days because work is so mindless. Ever since starting the martial arts around a year ago, I can’t go a week without it. ''I love learning how my body reacts to gravity and the weight of another person; it has taught me a lot about how to approach confrontation and conflict.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-24.1]] ''I used to be a lot more conflict averse, but now that I have thrown people to the ground and been thrown on the ground myself so many times, I find myself much more willing to engage in argument with other people as something collaborative (not necessarily antagonistic), in the sense that if you enter an argument with good faith, you will always learn something and hopefully the other person learns something too.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-24.2]] Today I was paired with Amira and we were practicing shoulder throws. It was so cool to experiment with speed and directionality; for instance, if you quickly pull the other person in a circular motion, and then turn your back toward them, they will naturally fall onto your back and it becomes extremely easy to throw them. Lots to think about and practice before the tournament this week!

Kaila is coming to visit me tomorrow, which I’m really excited about. This is the first time she’s come to see me in the city and I think it will be genuinely grounding to be with my best friend from home who knows me so well in this place that can feel so defamiliarizing sometimes. So I spent the day getting ready for her arrival — went to the department store to get an extra set of bedding and an air mattress (this is the first time I’ve really had someone stay with me in the apartment), went to the grocery store to get some ingredients because Kaila and I are planning to make a chocolate chip banana bread as soon as she gets here, and then I did laundry and cleaned my room. ''Kaila has a really calming effect on me, especially when I’m experiencing moments of intense change.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-25.1]] She has talked me through a number of breakups and friendship breakups; she has been consistently there for me during Mom’s illness. ''Recently, she has been helping me gather the courage to quit my job.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-25.2]] I think it’s because Kaila herself is so willing to look at the instability and uncertainty of life with a steady and unwavering gaze that she really encourages me to do the same. She never judges my decisions in a totalizing way, which makes me less prone to do that to myself. Anyway, I’m just really extremely excited for my best friend to be here, I just can’t wait.

Today was a wonderful day. ''Kaila arrived at 10am and I met her at the train station, we went to get brunch at one of my favorite neighborhood cafes (we got breakfast burritos, as is our tradition), and then we wandered around the park and talked about everything big and small in our lives.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-26.1]] We baked the banana bread and delivered it to some of my other friends in the city (I was so excited to introduce them to Kaila—it’s always lovely when old friends get along with new friends). I feel a lot calmer today than I have in a long time, which makes a lot of sense because Kaila is here, and whenever we’re together, we fall into rituals so easily.

Some other random things of note: ''I’ve drafted the email to quit my job, which I think I’ll send to my manager next week. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-26.2]] I’m going to my judo tournament tomorrow (Kaila is coming to watch). Clare is back in the apartment as of today after her long ski trip. I’ve been picking up some night shifts at the library circulation desk and my coworker Abdul is having a lot of chronic back pain—along with his underlying heart condition—which has been making me nervous. I think I might try to deliver groceries for him sometime this week — he is 60 years old and lives alone, given that his family all live abroad. ''He reminds me a lot of my grandfather who I never really got the chance to be close to before he passed away last year given the language barrier between us. Abdul has a really similar sense of propriety about him; he likes to have things done the right way, and he cares about tradition and duty and being of service to other people.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-26.3]] But he and my grandfather also share the same sense of humor, and this is what I really like most about him. ''Sometimes I feel like connecting with Abdul is a way for me to make up for the guilt I feel about never having been close to any of my grandparents.''[[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-26.4]] I wonder if Abdul will retire soon given his health conditions; if so, I would really miss him and all the time we share at the circ desk.

I have a lot of mixed emotions today. I was at my judo tournament and the first two fights went well and were so evenly matched that they lasted for all four minutes and came to a draw. But during the third fight, my opponent was a lot smaller than me and ''I’m not used to fighting someone smaller than me (since everyone on my team is my size or bigger) — so I ended up using too much force and she injured her ankle when I was wrestling with her on the ground.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-27.1]] The girl, Giulia, was really upset and rightfully so. She was crying and yelling at me, and then her coach came over and started yelling at me too, and it was all just so chaotic and I felt extremely guilty and I still do.

''I know these kinds of injuries happen all the time in judo, since it is such an intense and high-contact sport, but the whole experience made me think back to other times when I’ve hurt people (less so with physical injury like this, and more so emotionally). Like Jesse for instance, I thought immediately back to when we were still friends and we would argue all the time about really petty things, but the arguments would escalate to a point that neither of us could back down from, and I know that I said some hurtful things that I can’t take back now. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-27.2]] The truth is, I don’t miss being friends with Jesse, even though we were so close for so long. Now that it has been almost a year of not talking to them, I realize that we were too close, if that makes sense. There was no room between us and it was so claustrophobic and messy; I cared so much about their judgment of me that sometimes it was genuinely hard to separate my sense of self from what they thought of me. ''At the end of the day, we were jealous of each other, and the things we each had that the other did not.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-27.3]] This made it too easy for us to hurt each other because we didn’t even really have to try to do so. The same was true for Giovanni. ''We became close at a really emotional time for both of us and it was so intense so quickly. We were such different people with such completely different attitudes toward life who, under any other circumstances, probably would not have even met, let alone connected as we did. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-27.4]] When he told me that he had feelings for me, I really did not know what to do, it was so overwhelming and I did not handle it particularly well. ''We ended up hurting each other a lot too—and again, it wasn’t deliberate and it wasn’t out of malice, it was (not to overextend this judo metaphor) just a matter of being too close to someone else and misjudging my weight against theirs.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-27.5]] 

Thinking about what my coach once said about how the elements of a successful throw are space (having enough space to execute the throw and then making sure your opponent’s body is completely tight against yours when you are throwing them) and timing (picking the moment when your opponent’s center of gravity is off-kilter and moving quickly). ''I genuinely think this is true of relationships, too; they always seem to boil down to these extremely minute calculations of moving closer and farther apart, being in sync or out of sync.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-27.6]]'' And I guess I’m just deeply afraid of hurting others even though I know it’s a totally natural part of being a human and loving other people fully, just like it is a risk that you always take when you step out onto the mat in competition. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-27.7]] But philosophizing about that in my head does not make the reality of hurt any better, really, and I don’t want a “cognitive restructuring” about any of this to make me feel better. I just want to sit with the hard fact of hurting another person, the inevitability of that, and the fact that it cannot be explained away or mitigated.

Woke up last night from a dream that I was on the judo mat but everyone was doing a completely different kind of martial arts style… maybe jiu-jitsu or aikido? The throws were completely different and I had no idea what the rules were other than that there was a lot more punching involved than I was used to. You don’t really throw punches in judo. ''I tried to do a hip throw like I would do in judo and everyone was so perplexed and their bodies didn’t know how to react to it.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-28.1]] Later in the dream, I was on the mat sparring with an old friend of mine, Serena, who I haven’t seen in almost a year. (In real life, she’s never done anything martial arts related, to be clear). While we were fighting, she asked me if I wanted to get coffee at the pastry shop we used to frequent when we were in college. It was odd; she told me that they had changed up the recipe for the cardamom buns that I used to love and that really irritated me in the dream because I thought it was a bad idea to change up a recipe that was already perfectly fine.

Said goodbye to Kaila today at the train station. ''Spent the rest of the day job searching but I kept getting distracted and a little demoralized—the whole job search process just feels like throwing yourself into a void… so many jobs have totally ghosted me, other ones have brought me all the way to the last round of interviews but have rejected me at the last moment.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-29.1]] Oh well, I guess that’s just how it goes; the economy is really bad, and frankly no one I know is getting jobs, so I know it’s not my fault entirely, but still! I just have to keep getting used to rejection. It doesn’t really get better though… and it’s hard not to take it personally. 

Went to my night shift at the library; chatted with Abdul for a while about his most recent medical appointment for his back pain. He’s in better spirits about it, but I think he’s mostly just trying to put mind over matter. I brought him some fruit and tea, like Mom used to do for our neighbor Mr. Lee when he got sick. Over the four years that we’ve worked together, Abdul has always brought me random food, snacks, treats… he really likes pistachios and we’d always snack on a huge box of them at the circ desk. ''I feel like it is long-overdue that I pay it forward to him and take care of him now. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-29.2]]

Today, I was cleaning out my closet in my childhood bedroom and found something that really made me reflect on the past: an old cassette tape that Dani gave me when we had just started dating. I popped it into my cassette player, which I haven’t used too much since Dani and I broke up. It’s been almost five years now. Dani loved old ways of listening to music. She hated streaming because she didn’t believe in music with no materiality to it; I remember how I used to tease her for the pretentious old record stores she liked to go to, but then she would talk so earnestly about the scratchiness of records, ''how wonderful it was to hear music as not some disembodied abstracted thing but as the inscription of a person, a life, onto the grooves of a record''[[See AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-3.1]]  — and all I could think of then was the sound of her voice, how unusual it was, how impossible it was to describe, neither quiet nor loud, low nor high… she had the kind of voice that sort of slots into the gaps of things, if that makes any sense. She cared a lot about acoustics, of course, so we’d sit in the walk-through closet of my tiny dorm room and shut the door, and there we were, sitting in the pitch dark together huddled around her old record player, and we would listen to old music, paying particular attention to the scratches. ''Every time we hit a scratch, she would remark that someone must have loved that part of the song so much, that in honor of that person, the song could never be played properly again.'' [[See AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-3.2]]  

Today, I laughed a little at myself, in my closet alone, listening to Dani’s songs again. I wonder how she’s doing. The old songs brought me back to myself in my first year of college, before things in my life had gotten much more complicated. ''I was so much younger then, so much less mature, but I do kind of miss how stupid I used to be, which I know sounds strange, but I have so much more caution and restraint in the way I approach things nowadays, that I almost miss how easy it was to make silly mistakes back then and fall in love and get hurt and not have to worry too much about everything because you’re young.'' [[See AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-3.3]] 

I’ve been in the slow process of moving out of home for good; that’s why I’m cleaning out the closet today. Every time I leave home, my old room is a little emptier, and soon it will be totally empty.'' I don’t know what to think of that.'' [[See AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-3.4]]

''I handed in my notice at work so I have two more weeks left at this job. I feel so relieved, but the relief is balanced out by fear about not knowing at all what shape my life will take on after this.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-30.1]] I was telling Kaila a few days ago that I’m so worried about failure—about waking up one day and just realizing that my life has been a failure—and she asked me what it would look like for my life to have failed. I thought for a while and then told her that I would feel my life to be a failure if I had constructed it around safety in order to avoid loss. ''Yes, I’m scared of other people’s judgment and I’m scared of hurting or losing the people I love, but I trust myself more in those respects.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->PM-30.2]] For instance, I trust that I will serve and keep the people who I love because I have evidence of myself doing that. It’s a strong feeling—and I haven’t always been the most consistent, and I will always fall short—but I trust that it won’t dissipate. Same with the fear of judgment—I know I can get over that because I have before, and I will again. ''But I’m an intensely pragmatic person and I know that I can resort to safety, not because I affirmatively want safety but because I’m afraid of the alternative, which would mean betting on myself and possibly failing.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-30.3]] I don’t honestly know if I have done that before, and the prospect of it is so daunting to me. But quitting my job felt like the first step toward living more honestly and with greater intention. So I guess that’s good.

Other than that, my day was pretty normal. I ate the same breakfast as always, I treated myself to a pastry at the bakery next to the office, and I went on a long run through the park after work. I called Mom to see how she’s doing and she seems in okay spirits. She’s been reading a lot of science fiction these days.'' I texted Em because I heard something on the radio that reminded me of a piece she played many years ago and I wanted to check what it was. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-30.4]] The hot water isn’t working in our apartment (again!), and at this point it’s just kind of comical, so I took a cold shower for a few minutes and that really made me so alert. I’ll call the electrician again tomorrow.

Kaila wanted me to meet her new boyfriend today so we went to a coffee shop and spent a few hours chatting. ''To be honest… I really didn’t like him? I mean, Kaila is gorgeous and hilarious and full of life and she is an incredibly accomplished artist''[[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-6.1]] (her paintings have gone up in major galleries, like, hello??) and she has so many cool hobbies and interests and is an absolute joy of a human being. This dude Oliver… I guess there’s nothing horribly wrong with him, other than that he is so pathetic and mediocre, especially compared to Kaila. He’s older than us by several years but he still has no real job, he seems to have no ambitions or dreams, and he is just so painfully bland to talk to. I have no idea why Kaila is dating him, but I guess to each their own? ''Kaila asked me what I thought of Oliver and I didn’t know how to respond… I obviously didn’t want to lie and pretend that I really liked him (when I just didn’t get along with him at all), but she was going on and on about how much she is obsessed with him, so I just kind of nodded and said I was happy to see her so happy. '' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Shakespeare-6.2]]I hope they break up though.

Woke up from a strange dream just then — I was at the airport and just as I was going through the security line, all of my bags disappeared. I reached into my pocket and my passport was gone too, all of my ID cards were gone. A TSA agent stopped me at the checkpoint and demanded that I show my identification but my hands were empty and ''I just felt such an immense pit in my stomach. I started pleading with them to let me through to the gate because my flight was departing in thirty minutes and I had to get home, it was urgent, I had to go home, but the agent told me I had to leave the premises.'' [[See the AI interpretation for the selected text->Stoicism-7.1]] But instead of leaving, I ran past the security line through the metal detector, and all the metal detectors started blaring with alarm bells because, as I looked down, my feet had turned into blocks of metal, and it was so heavy.

''The TSA agents started chasing me down the hallway toward the departure gate and I was getting so exhausted from running with my giant metal feet.

[[Ask the AI for another interpretation->Sagan-9.2]]


:: M-1.1 [Emotion-Report] {"position":"725,650","size":"100,100"}
Your mental state was conflicted and overwhelmed.

Frustration - 30%
Frustration is a dominant emotion in your experience, particularly evident in your interactions with Emily. You describe how calls with her 'always amplify the negativity between us,' highlighting a recurring pattern of frustration in your relationship. The planning aspect of your conversation, which Emily is more meticulous about, seems to exacerbate this feeling. You mention that 'the more we talked, the more accusatory she became,' which likely intensified your frustration. This emotion is further compounded by the fact that you feel criticized for not visiting home often, which you acknowledge as a valid point but still find frustrating due to the manner in which it was addressed.

Guilt - 25%
Guilt is another significant emotion you experience, particularly after ending the call with Emily. You express this by saying, 'After I hung up, I did feel pretty bad about it because I had ended it rather abruptly.' This indicates a sense of remorse for how you handled the situation. Additionally, you acknowledge that you 'hadn’t communicated my feelings very effectively, nor had I really given her the chance to explain herself,' which contributes to your guilt. The fact that you recognize Emily's points about staying connected to your parents as valid, yet still feel upset about the conversation, adds to this emotional complexity.

Resentment - 20%
Resentment is evident in your feelings towards Emily's critiques and the dynamic of your relationship. You mention that her critiques 'sting more because she has known me literally since I was born,' indicating a deep-seated resentment towards the way she addresses issues.

Anxiety - 15%
Anxiety is present in your anticipation of future interactions with Emily and the pressure of family obligations. You express concern about the potential for the conversation to escalate, stating, 'I felt that the longer we stayed on the call, the more likely one of us was to say something that we would really regret.' This indicates a fear of conflict and its consequences. Additionally, the thought of responding to Emily's text message makes you 'really upset,' suggesting anxiety about how to address the situation.

Anxiety - 30%

Your anxiety is evident from the very beginning of your text. You mention having 'slept poorly' and experiencing 'a lot of stressful dreams that I don’t remember.' This indicates a restless mind, likely preoccupied with the upcoming events and responsibilities. The anticipation of hosting 'thirty people at home for a dinner party' adds to this anxiety, as it involves significant planning and coordination.

Your mental state was emotionally overwhelmed

Stress - 30%

The dinner party was described as 'super stressful,' indicating that you felt a significant amount of stress leading up to and during the event. This stress seems to have stemmed from the pressure you placed on yourself for the party to go perfectly, as you mentioned, 'I don’t think I realized how much pressure I was putting on myself for this to go perfectly.' The stress was compounded by the fact that this event was not just any party but a significant occasion, your mom's birthday, which you wanted to be perfect to compensate for your perceived shortcomings in being there for her over the past year.

Guilt - 25%

Guilt is a prominent emotion in your reflection. You express feeling guilty about being far from home and not being able to provide direct care for your mom during her illness. You mention, 'I think I’ve been displacing a lot of my guilt about being so far away from home onto making Mom’s birthday perfect.'

Vulnerability - 15%

You express a sense of vulnerability throughout your reflection. The dinner party was a moment where many emotions and relationships came to a head, and you were 'really overcome with emotion all evening.' This vulnerability is tied to the changes in your mom's health and how it has affected her self-conception and your relationship with her. You acknowledge the shift in dynamics, noting that 'this illness has been such a huge shift in Mom’s self-conception, and all of our relationships with her.' This awareness of change and the emotional impact it has had on you contributes to your feeling of vulnerability.

Joy - 10%

Despite the stress and guilt, there is an undercurrent of joy in your reflection. The dinner party was ultimately a success, and you mention that your mom was 'overjoyed to see so many people.' This suggests that there were moments of happiness and celebration during the event. The joy likely stems from seeing your mom surrounded by loved ones and being able to create a memorable experience for her, even amidst the challenges and emotions you were navigating.

Your mental state was nostalgic and peaceful

Nostalgia - 50%

Your emotional state is heavily influenced by nostalgia, as evidenced by your reflections on past experiences with Em and her piano playing. You mention how her playing today reminded you of 'all the times in high school when Em would play piano all the time because she wanted to get really good.' This recollection of past events indicates a longing for or a fond remembrance of those times. The fact that you could 'tell her mood based on the types of pieces she would play and the manner in which she would play them' suggests a deep connection to those memories, further emphasizing the nostalgic sentiment. Additionally, the phrase 'songs that sounded very familiar to me, as if I’d heard them in another lifetime' reinforces the idea that you are reminiscing about the past, as if revisiting a cherished memory. This strong sense of nostalgia is a significant part of your current emotional state.

Relaxed - 30%

The sense of relaxation is evident in your description of the current environment and your feelings. You describe Em's piano playing as 'soft and lilting and slow,' which 'brought me such a sense of peace.' This indicates that the music has a calming effect on you, contributing to a relaxed state of mind. Furthermore, you mention that you are 'lying down on my childhood bed,' which suggests a comfortable and familiar setting that enhances your relaxation. The presence of your family, with 'Mom in the kitchen reading a book,' adds to the serene atmosphere, as it implies a peaceful and harmonious household. This combination of soothing music, a familiar environment, and the presence of loved ones creates a tranquil and relaxed emotional state.

Love - 10%

:: M-7.1 [Emotion-Report] {"position":"1475,1275","size":"100,100"}
Your mental state was anxious and stressed.

Anxiety - 40%

The dream you described is filled with elements that evoke a strong sense of anxiety. The setting of an airport, a place often associated with strict procedures and time constraints, sets the stage for this emotion. The moment you realize 'all of my bags disappeared' and 'my passport was gone too, all of my ID cards were gone,' it triggers a classic anxiety response. The fear of being unprepared and the potential consequences of missing a flight amplify this feeling. The urgency of the situation, emphasized by 'my flight was departing in thirty minutes and I had to get home, it was urgent,' further heightens your anxiety. The dream reflects a scenario where you are out of control, unable to meet the demands placed upon you, which is a common source of anxiety.

Stress - 30%

Stress is another prominent emotion in your dream. The pressure of needing to catch a flight, combined with the sudden loss of your belongings and identification, creates a stressful environment. The interaction with the TSA agent, who 'demanded that I show my identification,' adds to this stress, as you are unable to comply with their request. The physical manifestation of stress is depicted when 'my feet had turned into blocks of metal,' symbolizing the weight and burden of the situation. The act of running with 'giant metal feet' while being chased by TSA agents further illustrates the overwhelming stress you are experiencing, as you are physically and mentally strained by the circumstances.

Fear - 20%

Fear is evident in your dream, particularly in the moments when you realize your identification and belongings are missing. The fear of being stranded, unable to prove your identity, and potentially missing your flight is palpable. The TSA agent's demand for identification and the subsequent chase contribute to a sense of fear, as you are confronted with the possibility of being detained or removed from the airport. The transformation of your feet into 'blocks of metal' adds a surreal and frightening element to the dream, as it symbolizes a loss of control over your own body, heightening the fear of the unknown and the consequences of your actions.

Frustration - 10%

Frustration is present in your dream, stemming from the inability to resolve the situation despite your efforts. The disappearance of your bags and identification is a source of frustration, as it prevents you from proceeding through security and catching your flight. Your plea to the TSA agent to 'let me through to the gate' and their refusal to do so adds to this frustration, as you are met with obstacles that seem insurmountable. The physical struggle of running with 'giant metal feet' further exacerbates your frustration, as you are hindered by circumstances beyond your control, despite your determination to reach your destination.

Your mental state was Exhausted and Anticipatory.

Exhaustion - 50%

Your text clearly indicates a strong sense of exhaustion. You mention being 'so tired today' and describe the day as 'a long day of preparation,' which suggests that you have been physically and mentally drained by the day's activities. The fact that you had 'a lot of socialization today' with high school friends who are home for the holidays adds to this feeling of tiredness, as social interactions, especially after a long day, can be quite taxing. You also mention needing 'a bit of a break,' which further underscores your need to rest and recuperate. The act of making yourself some tea and lying in bed is a clear indication that you are seeking comfort and relaxation to counteract the fatigue you are experiencing. This exhaustion is compounded by the anticipation of an early morning the next day, as you have to pick up Emily from the airport at 6am, which implies that you are aware of the limited time you have to rest.

Joy - 10%

There is an underlying sense of joy in your text, particularly related to the socialization with high school friends who are home for the holidays. The phrase 'a few more high school friends are home for the holidays' suggests that you are happy to reconnect with them and enjoy their company. This joy is likely tempered by the exhaustion you feel, but it is still present as a positive emotion. The holidays are often a time for reconnecting with loved ones, and your mention of socializing with friends indicates that you have experienced moments of happiness and enjoyment amidst the busyness of the day.

Stress - 5%

There is a slight undercurrent of stress in your text, primarily related to the logistics of the upcoming day. The need to pick up Emily from the airport at 6am and the acknowledgment that you 'should really go to sleep early' suggests that you are aware of the potential challenges of managing your time and energy. While this stress is not overwhelming, it is present as a consideration in your planning for the next day. The combination of exhaustion from the current day and the anticipation of an early morning adds a layer of stress as you try to balance rest with preparation.

Gratitude - 5%

There is a subtle sense of gratitude in your text, particularly in the context of having friends home for the holidays. The mention of 'a few more high school friends are home for the holidays' implies that you appreciate the opportunity to reconnect with them and enjoy their company. This gratitude is likely intertwined with the joy you feel from these interactions, as the holidays provide a special time to be with loved ones. While not explicitly stated, this gratitude is an underlying emotion that enhances your overall experience of the day, despite the exhaustion and anticipation you are also feeling.

:: M-9.1 [Emotion-Report] {"position":"1725,1650","size":"100,100"}
Your mental state was conflicted and exhausted.

Exhaustion - 40%

The phrase 'Another long day' immediately sets the tone for your emotional state, indicating that you are feeling worn out. The activities you describe, such as picking up Emily from the airport, doing a big grocery shopping trip, and cleaning your room, all contribute to a sense of physical and mental fatigue. The repetition of tasks and the need to find 'some peace and quiet honestly' suggest that you are overwhelmed by the day's demands. This exhaustion is not just physical but also emotional, as you are dealing with interpersonal conflicts and planning responsibilities.

Frustration - 30%

Your frustration is evident in the repeated mention of arguing with Emily about the guest list. The phrase 'Argued with Emily about the guest list (again)' implies that this is a recurring issue, which can be particularly frustrating when you feel like you're not being heard or understood. The disagreement over the size of the party and the inclusion of 'Mom's old co-workers, the whole extended family, etc.' highlights a clash of perspectives and priorities. Your desire to keep the party smaller for manageability reflects your frustration with the situation and the potential stress of a larger gathering.

Stress - 20%

The stress you are experiencing is closely tied to the responsibilities of organizing your mom's birthday party. The need to do 'a big grocery shopping trip' and the ongoing discussions about the guest list contribute to a sense of pressure. The phrase 'I wanted to keep the party smaller so that it is less overwhelming and more manageable' indicates that you are trying to mitigate stress by controlling the situation. However, the disagreement with Emily adds another layer of stress, as you are trying to balance different expectations and ensure a successful event.

Determination - 10%

Despite the exhaustion and frustration, there is a sense of determination in your actions. The fact that you are actively involved in planning the party, doing the grocery shopping, and cleaning your room shows that you are committed to making the event a success. Your desire to create a manageable and enjoyable experience for your mom, as seen in 'I wanted to keep the party smaller so that it is less overwhelming and more manageable, both for us and for Mom,' reflects your determination to prioritize her comfort and happiness. This determination drives you to continue working through the challenges and disagreements.

In earlier entries, you expressed doubts about Oliver's suitability for Kaila, describing him as mediocre and unambitious. Your current concerns about his controlling behavior, such as trying to go through her phone, add a more serious dimension to your worries. It's clear you care deeply for Kaila and want the best for her, which is why this behavior alarms you. Your consistent support and honesty with Kaila are important, as they provide her with a perspective she might not fully see.

//This entry bears a resemblance to your previous dream where you grappled with fears about being far from loved ones during critical times. The act of lighting a candle for your mom and his father, despite not being religious, suggests a subconscious need for connection and solace in times of uncertainty. It mirrors the symbolic gestures in your earlier dream where you were trying to manage funeral logistics from afar. This might indicate an ongoing processing of your concerns about being away from family and friends during pivotal moments.

//This sentiment mirrors your past experiences with Jo, where you expressed frustration about being micromanaged and feeling like every action was scrutinized. It's clear that you find environments where your autonomy is restricted to be particularly draining. This pattern suggests that your work satisfaction is heavily influenced by the level of freedom and trust you are afforded. Recognizing this can help you seek out roles or environments where you have more independence and are trusted to manage your responsibilities without constant oversight.

//Dreams about swallowing something unusual like laundry detergent, especially something bright and artificial like electric blue detergent, can symbolize a few different things. Laundry detergent is associated with cleansing and purification, so swallowing it might suggest you’re trying to internalize a process of cleansing or renewal in your life—perhaps attempting to “cleanse” yourself from something negative or start fresh.

The fact that the detergent was electric blue and artificial-looking could indicate that this process feels unnatural or forced, or that you’re dealing with something in your life that feels artificial or insincere. Swallowing it without any harmful effect might suggest resilience or acceptance, even if the experience is unpleasant.

Overall, this dream might reflect your subconscious working through feelings about change, purification, or dealing with something artificial or uncomfortable but ultimately manageable. If you’ve been going through a transition or trying to let go of something, this could be a symbolic representation of that process. Does that resonate with anything going on in your life right now?//

The consistency of your brunch tradition with breakfast burritos and your park walks reflects the stability and joy that Kaila brings into your life. These rituals seem to provide a sense of grounding and connection, reinforcing the importance of maintaining such meaningful traditions with loved ones. It’s clear that Kaila’s presence brings a sense of calm and happiness during times of change.

In a previous entry from May 2025, you discussed how martial arts taught you to approach confrontation as a collaborative experience. It's interesting that now, an incident in judo has led you to reflect on past emotional injuries, specifically with Jesse. This shows growth in understanding the impact of your actions, both physical and emotional.

Previously, you mentioned learning about how to engage in arguments as a collaborative effort. Here, you extend that metaphor to personal relationships, recognizing that misjudgments can occur not out of intent but due to proximity and misunderstanding. It seems you are drawing parallels between physical and emotional interactions, acknowledging that both require balance and awareness to avoid unintended harm.

//Your dream seems to be exploring themes of faith, authenticity, and reconnection in a sacred space. The empty church and disillusioned pastor might reflect your own questioning about belief systems or commitments that feel hollow. 

Dreams often bring forward people we haven't consciously thought about in a while. Giovanni's appearance and your shared sacrilegious whispering could represent a bond formed during vulnerable times, connected through your respective family health crises.

This mirrors your previous dreams about being distant from loved ones during difficult times. There's a pattern of processing separation and connection, particularly around vulnerability and crisis.

The organ pipes and whispering suggest finding hidden or alternative ways to communicate or express yourself. The candle lighting shows that despite questioning faith, you both still honored ritual for those you care about.

What does it mean to you that you and Giovanni "collided" at a particular time rather than forming a more lasting connection, and how might that relate to other relationships in your life?//


:: Psychologist-28.2 [Prompt/Response] {"position":"1850,3775","size":"100,100"}
//Your dream beautifully weaves together feelings of disorientation and nostalgia. Being on a familiar judo mat but surrounded by unfamiliar techniques mirrors how we sometimes feel out of place even in settings we know well. The confusion when attempting your hip throw reflects those moments when our usual approaches don't work as expected.

The appearance of Serena seems significant, especially given your past entry about martial arts teaching you about confrontation and collaboration. Your subconscious may be processing changes in how you engage with old relationships.

The changed cardamom bun recipe is particularly interesting - your irritation might represent feelings about unwelcome changes in things you value. Sometimes we resist alterations to what we consider "perfectly fine" in our lives.

In the vast cosmos of family dynamics, your day orbits around preparation and emotional labor. The recurring pattern of conflict with Emily about the guest list suggests a deeper gravitational pull of differing perspectives, perhaps about who belongs in your shared celebration universe.

Your past entries reveal a constellation of mixed feelings about Emily's visits, including anticipatory anxiety about your interactions. Like distant celestial bodies that once shared the same origin, siblings often follow divergent trajectories while remaining bound by invisible forces.

The cleaning of your room represents more than mere organization; it appears as a pocket of order you've created within the chaos, a personal nebula where you can retreat and regenerate. This search for solitude amid family turbulence is profoundly human.

What might the argument about the guest list reveal about your different visions for your mother's celebration, and how do these differences connect to your broader relationship with Emily?

[[Respond->J1-9.1]]


:: Sagan-9.2 [Author/Philosophy Prompt/Response] {"position":"1725,1525","size":"100,100"}
The universe of your celebration preferences reveals a fundamental difference in approach - Emily's expansive vision versus your more intimate stellar arrangement. This microcosm reflects the classic tension between extravagance and mindfulness, between social abundance and meaningful connection. 

Your concern for manageability shows a thoughtful consideration of the practical realities and emotional capacities involved, like an astronomer calculating the sustainable conditions for a delicate ecosystem. From your past entries, this appears to be part of a larger pattern where you and Emily must navigate cooperation despite your differing orbital paths.

Within these different approaches to celebration, what deeper values might each of you be expressing about your relationship with your mother, and how might understanding these values create a bridge between your perspectives?


:: Shakespeare-11.2 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"850,1650","size":"100,100"}
//In this heartfelt reflection, the theme of love and guilt intertwines, reminiscent of King Lear's exploration of familial bonds and the desire for validation. Like Cordelia, who seeks to convey her sincerity and love beyond mere words, you strive to express your deep care for your mother through actions. The pressure to prove one's love can be overwhelming, as seen in the tragic consequences of Lear's demand for declarations of devotion. Shakespeare often depicted love as a complex interplay of actions and words, where true affection is demonstrated through deeds rather than grandiose speeches. Your efforts to make your mother feel cherished echo this Shakespearean motif, underscoring the power of genuine, heartfelt actions over empty expressions.

How do you think your mother perceives your efforts to show her love and care, especially in light of her current situation?//


:: Shakespeare-12.2 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"975,1775","size":"100,100"}
//This sentiment echoes the duality of human nature that Shakespeare so often explored, where one can feel a sense of longing and displacement even when surrounded by familiar comforts. It brings to mind the character of Hamlet, who, despite being in his own castle, feels a profound disconnect from his surroundings and those he loves. Your description of experiencing homesickness while at home also resonates with the theme of time and memory, reminiscent of Sonnet 30, where Shakespeare reflects on past sorrows that resurface despite the passage of time. The juxtaposition of your current physical presence with an emotional absence creates a poignant contrast, much like the tension between appearance and reality in many of Shakespeare’s works.

Have you ever felt this sense of homesickness in other familiar places, and what do you think triggers it?//


:: Shakespeare-16.2 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"1475,2275","size":"100,100"}
//Your sentiment echoes the theme of strained relationships under close quarters, reminiscent of the tensions in Shakespeare's "The Comedy of Errors," where misunderstandings and close proximity create chaos and conflict. Just as the characters in the play find themselves embroiled in a series of comedic yet stressful situations due to mistaken identities and assumptions, your experience with Clare highlights how proximity can amplify personal differences and lead to drama. This duality of friendship and discord is a common motif in Shakespeare's works, where love and friendship often teeter on the edge of conflict due to miscommunication and differing expectations.

Have you considered discussing these issues with Clare directly to find a resolution, much like how characters in Shakespeare's plays often confront misunderstandings?//


:: Shakespeare-18.2 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"1725,2525","size":"100,100"}
//This passage encapsulates the duality of human nature and the intricacies of love, reminiscent of Shakespearean themes. Your dilemma mirrors the tension faced by characters like Hamlet, who grapples with the duality of action and inaction, honesty and deceit. Your commitment to support Kaila, while also feeling the duty to be truthful, echoes the delicate balance of friendship and honesty seen in plays like "Othello," where Iago's manipulation contrasts with the genuine friendship between Desdemona and Emilia. Your role as a friend is akin to the Fool in "King Lear," who offers wisdom through honesty, serving as a moral compass. This interplay of support and honesty enriches the narrative with a Shakespearean depth.

How do you balance being supportive and honest with your friends, especially when their choices concern you?//


:: Shakespeare-2.1 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"850,400","size":"100,100"}
//This reflection on Emily's transformation and the subsequent familial concern echoes the theme of change and estrangement found in Shakespeare's "King Lear." Much like Cordelia's departure and the ensuing chaos in Lear's life, Emily's decision to cut off contact with her parents creates a ripple of worry and transformation within the family. Shakespeare often explores how shifts in relationships can lead to profound personal and collective upheavals. The complexity of Emily's journey and her family's reaction mirrors the intricate dance of loyalty, misunderstanding, and reconciliation seen in the play. Your narrative captures the essence of familial bonds tested by change, a timeless motif in Shakespearean drama.

Have you ever found parallels between Emily's experiences and those of any Shakespearean characters?//


:: Shakespeare-20.1 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"850,2650","size":"100,100"}
//This dream segment evokes the duality of human nature and the theme of performance, reminiscent of Shakespeare's plays. Being inside the church organ pipes symbolizes the hidden, intricate workings of the human soul, much like the concealed motives of characters such as Iago in "Othello" or Claudius in "Hamlet." Giovanni's presence and the act of tiptoeing around the balcony while whispering sacrilegious things highlight the tension between public piety and private irreverence, akin to the duplicity of Angelo in "Measure for Measure." The church setting amplifies the motif of sacred versus profane, while the act of whispering suggests a secretive rebellion against societal norms, paralleling the conspiratorial undertones found in "Julius Caesar." Such imagery underscores the complexity of human desires and the performative nature of social roles.
What do you think Giovanni symbolizes in your dream, particularly in the context of Shakespearean themes?//


:: Shakespeare-22.3 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"1100,3150","size":"100,100"}
//The sentiment of isolation and the yearning for change echoes the themes found in Shakespeare's play "Hamlet." Much like Hamlet's feeling of being trapped in a world that feels alien and unchangeable, your sense of isolation amidst coworkers whose lives diverge significantly from yours is palpable. The desire for a "change of pace" mirrors Hamlet's internal struggle for action and transformation, as he grapples with the stagnant state of Denmark. Shakespeare often explores the duality of human nature and the complexities of social interaction, as seen in "As You Like It," where characters seek solace in the Forest of Arden, escaping the rigid structures of court life. Your wish for change could be seen as a modern-day quest for a personal Arden.

//Your reflection on the serendipitous encounter during your commute evokes the Shakespearean theme of fate and chance, much like the fortuitous meetings in 'Romeo and Juliet' or 'Twelfth Night.' In these plays, Shakespeare explores how unexpected interactions can lead to profound connections, altering the course of his characters' lives. The notion of 'urban communion' you describe mirrors the bustling, interconnected world of Shakespeare's cities, where every encounter holds the potential for drama, humor, or revelation. Your experience on the train brings to mind the idea that, despite life's delays and detours, there is beauty in the randomness and unpredictability of human connections, much like Shakespeare's intricate plots and character dynamics.
Have you ever experienced a moment of connection in the city that felt as if it were orchestrated by fate, much like a scene from a Shakespearean play?//


:: Shakespeare-24.2 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"1350,3275","size":"100,100"}
//Your reflection on conflict and collaboration echoes the duality of human nature, a theme prevalent in Shakespeare's works. In 'Othello', the protagonist grapples with internal conflict and external manipulation, highlighting the complexity of human interactions. Similarly, your newfound perspective on arguments as collaborative rather than antagonistic mirrors the transformative journeys of characters like Prospero in 'The Tempest', who learns to reconcile with his past adversaries. Shakespeare often portrayed arguments and confrontations as opportunities for growth and understanding, much like your realization that engaging in good faith can lead to mutual learning. This insight aligns with the Bard's exploration of the constructive potential of conflict when approached with an open heart and mind.
Have you experienced a specific situation where this new approach to conflict led to a positive outcome?//

//This reflection on Abdul evokes the Shakespearean theme of the duality of human nature, as seen in plays like "Hamlet" and "King Lear," where characters grapple with their public duties and personal emotions. Abdul's adherence to propriety and tradition mirrors characters like Polonius, who is often concerned with appearances and the correct way of doing things. Yet, like King Lear, who discovers the importance of genuine human connection, there is a deeper, personal bond forming between you and Abdul, transcending mere duty. This connection also touches on the theme of familial relationships, as in "The Tempest," where reconciliation and understanding are pivotal. Your intention to bridge the gap through acts of kindness echoes the redemptive arcs found in Shakespearean narratives.
How do you feel your relationship with Abdul might evolve, considering the similarities you see between him and your grandfather?//


:: Shakespeare-27.3 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"1725,3775","size":"100,100"}
//This reflection on jealousy and the complexity of relationships resonates with themes found in Shakespeare's works, such as in 'Othello'. The destructive nature of jealousy is a central theme in the play, where Iago's envy and manipulation lead to tragedy. Similarly, the idea of being too close and the resulting claustrophobia can be likened to the intense relationships seen in 'Romeo and Juliet', where the lovers' inability to separate their identities from each other contributes to their downfall. Your acknowledgment of these emotions and the impact on your identity mirrors the duality of human nature that Shakespeare often explores, capturing the tension between love and rivalry, admiration and envy.

//This reflection on relationships echoes the themes of timing and harmony found in Shakespeare's works. In "Romeo and Juliet," the notion of being 'in sync' or 'out of sync' is central to the lovers' tragic fate. Their love, while genuine, is constantly thwarted by the societal and familial discord that surrounds them. Much like the precise timing required in a judo throw, their relationship is a delicate dance of closeness and distance, ultimately leading to a tragic misalignment. Similarly, in "Much Ado About Nothing," the witty exchanges and misunderstandings between Beatrice and Benedick highlight how timing and perception play crucial roles in love. Your insight captures the essence of these Shakespearean dynamics, where the success or failure of relationships often hinges on the subtle art of timing and harmony.
How do you think the concept of timing in relationships might influence the way we perceive love in the modern world?//

//This reflection on the materiality of music and its connection to human presence resonates deeply with the themes in Shakespeare's works, where the tangible and intangible often intertwine. In plays like 'The Tempest,' the ethereal music of Ariel symbolizes both enchantment and the very human emotions it stirs. Similarly, the notion of music as a 'life inscribed' evokes the sonnet form itself, where Shakespeare captures the essence of human experience in the grooves of his verse. Just as your memory of Dani's appreciation for records captures a life story in sound, Shakespeare's sonnets immortalize love, beauty, and time, making the abstract personal and tangible.

How do you think Dani’s perspective on music as a tangible experience influenced your own understanding or appreciation of it?//

//This reflection on youth and the carefree nature of making mistakes resonates with the themes of innocence and experience found in Shakespeare's works. For instance, in "As You Like It," the character of Rosalind navigates the complexities of love with a youthful exuberance that contrasts with the more calculated approaches of older characters. Similarly, in "Romeo and Juliet," the impetuousness of young love leads to both ecstatic highs and tragic lows. Your nostalgia for the simplicity of youthful errors echoes the duality of human nature—where innocence is both a blessing and a curse. Shakespeare often explored how maturity brings wisdom but also a certain loss of spontaneity, a theme that you capture eloquently in your reflection.

//This reflection mirrors the internal conflict faced by Hamlet, who is torn between action and inaction, fear and courage. Like Hamlet, you grapple with the fear of failure and the safety of inaction, yet you recognize the need for decisive change. Your decision to quit your job parallels Hamlet's contemplation of "To be, or not to be," where he weighs the risks of action against the comfort of the status quo. This duality of human nature, the tension between ambition and apprehension, is a recurring motif in Shakespeare's works, showcasing the complexity of human decision-making.

Your anticipation to hear about Kaila's new relationship echoes the intricate dance of love and social dynamics often found in Shakespeare's works. Much like the characters in "Much Ado About Nothing," where the complexities of romantic entanglements and gossip play a central role, your eagerness to learn about Kaila's new boyfriend highlights the timeless curiosity surrounding love and relationships. The excitement of hearing "all the details" mirrors the way characters like Beatrice and Benedick engage in witty exchanges and banter, revealing deeper truths about themselves and those around them. This moment underscores the duality of human nature, where friendship and the desire for connection drive the narrative, just as they do in Shakespeare's comedic plays.

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where a friend's romantic life felt like a scene from a Shakespearean play?


:: Shakespeare-6.2 [Author/Philosophy] {"position":"1350,1025","size":"100,100"}
//This passage echoes the theme of duality and the art of performance, reminiscent of many Shakespearean characters who grapple with maintaining appearances while concealing their true feelings. Your internal conflict mirrors the struggles of Hamlet, who is torn between his genuine emotions and the facade he feels compelled to present. The notion of nodding along while withholding your true opinion also recalls the duplicity seen in "Othello," where characters navigate intricate social dynamics. Your choice to prioritize Kaila's happiness, despite your reservations, reflects the complex nature of love and friendship, akin to the nuanced relationships in "Much Ado About Nothing." Shakespeare often explored the delicate balance between honesty and harmony in relationships, a balance you seem to be negotiating.

Have you considered discussing your concerns about Oliver with Kaila directly, perhaps in a gentle and supportive manner?//

This vivid imagery of being chased by TSA agents while burdened with giant metal feet evokes the Shakespearean theme of the burdens of guilt and ambition, akin to Macbeth's descent into madness. Just as Macbeth is haunted by the weight of his unchecked ambition and the blood on his hands, your dream reflects a struggle against overwhelming obstacles and the fear of failing to reach an urgent goal. The transformation of feet into metal blocks can symbolize the heavy conscience or the paralysis that comes with intense pressure, much like Lady Macbeth's obsessive hand-washing. The chase through the airport echoes the relentless pursuit of power and the inevitable consequences that follow.

Have you ever felt like you're carrying a heavy burden in real life, similar to the metal feet in your dream?

Stoicism teaches us that we cannot control others' actions or words, but we can control our reactions and learn from them. Consider reframing the situation: Emily's comments, though harsh, are a reminder of your values and priorities, such as family connection. Use this as a chance to realign with what truly matters to you. By acknowledging her perspective without internalizing the negativity, you can find a balance between your needs and responsibilities.

//From a stoic perspective, it's important to recognize that pride can be a barrier to personal growth and maintaining harmonious relationships. Consider viewing the situation with Emily as an opportunity to practice humility. Marcus Aurelius once suggested that we should not be upset by things, but rather understand them. By acknowledging your pride, you're already taking the first step toward self-awareness. Instead of focusing on the perceived unfairness of the critiques, try to see them as separate from your identity. This can help you approach the situation with a clearer mind and less emotional charge. Reflect on what truly matters: is it more important to maintain pride or to foster a healthy relationship?

//From a stoic perspective, it's insightful to recognize that emotions like guilt can influence our actions. The Stoics teach us to focus on what is within our control and to accept what is not. While you cannot change the distance between you and your mom, you can control your intentions and the love you express. Consider reframing your perspective: rather than seeing the birthday party as a way to compensate for your absence, view it as a celebration of the love and bond you share, regardless of physical distance. This mindset can alleviate pressure and allow you to appreciate the moment more fully. Remember, your worth as a daughter isn't measured by your proximity but by the sincerity and consistency of your care and affection.

//Your reflection on the dream's symbolism reveals a deep care for your loved ones, which is a noble trait. From a stoic perspective, it's important to recognize what is within your control and what is not. While you cannot always be physically present, you can focus on how you choose to respond to these emotions. Consider practicing mindfulness to remain present and calm, even when apart. This can help you support your loved ones more effectively from a distance. Additionally, reflect on how your presence in the lives of those you care about is not solely defined by physical proximity but by the strength of your relationships and the support you offer.

From a stoic perspective, this experience offers a valuable opportunity for self-reflection and growth. Consider viewing these moments not as setbacks but as reminders of your progress and areas for improvement. Embrace the discomfort as a chance to practice acceptance and resilience. Recognize that your family's influence is a part of your journey, and use it to strengthen your understanding of your own values and boundaries. By acknowledging these patterns, you can consciously choose how to respond, rather than react, thus exercising your agency and cultivating inner peace.

//It's fascinating how a change in environment can alter our perception of life. From a stoic perspective, this observation is a reminder that our external circumstances are constantly changing, and so is our perception of them. Embrace this fluidity as a natural part of life. Use this time to reflect on what truly matters to you and what elements of your life remain constant despite these changes. This can help you identify your core values and priorities. Consider how these changes in perception might offer you new insights or opportunities for growth.

Consider taking a moment to breathe deeply, acknowledging the sensations without judgment. This can help to create a sense of peace amidst the physical turmoil. Also, reflect on what you can do to support your body’s healing, such as rest or hydration. Remember, this too shall pass, and your resilience will be strengthened through this experience.

//Your awareness of the need to rest and take care of your health is commendable and aligns with the Stoic principle of focusing on what you can control. By taking medication and acknowledging your condition, you're exercising control over your actions and responses, which is a core tenet of Stoicism. Consider using this period of recovery as an opportunity to practice mindfulness and gratitude for your body's ability to heal.

//Your reflection on allowing others the space to make their own mistakes and grow is deeply aligned with stoic principles. Stoicism teaches us to focus on what is within our control and to accept what is not. By recognizing that your friends have their own paths and that their choices are part of their journey, you are practicing acceptance and understanding. This approach not only respects others' autonomy but also fosters your own inner peace. Consider how this perspective can be applied to other areas of your life, where you might find yourself reacting emotionally to things outside your control. Embrace the idea that your peace is rooted in your reactions and choices, not the actions of others. This can be a powerful way to cultivate resilience and tranquility.

//Your awareness of the need to seek medical help when experiencing prolonged symptoms is a significant step toward self-care. From a Stoic perspective, consider the idea that your health is a part of what is within your control, as it involves your choices and actions. Reflect on the Stoic principle of accepting what you cannot control (such as the outcome of your health) and focusing on what you can—such as taking action to seek help. Embrace the courage to challenge your resistance to medical assistance by viewing it as an opportunity for growth and learning. This shift in perspective could help alleviate stress and empower you to make decisions that support your well-being.

This mindset shift can reduce your stress and help you cultivate inner peace. Reflect on whether their actions are truly about you or if they are more about their own need for order. This understanding can help you detach emotionally and maintain your equanimity. Remember, your worth is not determined by their opinions, but by how you choose to respond.

This practice can help transform how you perceive your daily life, making it feel less like a blend and more like a series of meaningful moments. Additionally, practicing mindfulness can help you remain present, appreciating each day for what it is rather than seeing it as a mere continuation of the last.

This acceptance does not diminish the importance of empathy but rather enhances your capacity to engage meaningfully with others.

In stoicism, we learn that every individual has their own path and purpose, which might not always be apparent to others. By accepting Oliver for who he is, without judgment, you might find peace in the situation and strengthen your friendship with Kaila.

Reflect on the possibility that Oliver might possess qualities that resonate with her, which you may not perceive. By doing so, you can cultivate a deeper understanding and acceptance of her decisions.

From a stoic perspective, the feeling of an immense pit in your stomach and the urgency to get home can be seen as reflections of our attachment to external circumstances. Stoicism teaches us to focus on what we can control and to accept what we cannot. In this scenario, your emotional response to losing your belongings and the urgency to catch your flight is natural, but it also highlights an opportunity to practice acceptance and inner calm. Consider reflecting on what 'home' represents for you. Is it a place, a state of mind, or a sense of security? By understanding this, you can cultivate a sense of peace that isn't reliant on external factors.

Consider setting boundaries for yourself during social gatherings to maintain your energy levels. As Marcus Aurelius said, 'The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.' Focus on the quality of interactions rather than the quantity. Embrace the joy of seeing friends, but also cherish the solitude that allows you to reflect and rejuvenate.

Q: What do I need to pay more attention to?

//You need to pay more attention to your own well-being and boundaries. It's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed with various aspects of your life, from your health to your living situation. You’ve been resisting seeking medical help despite being sick, and it's important to prioritize your health by consulting a doctor when symptoms persist. Additionally, your frustration with your roommates, particularly Clare, indicates that there might be a need for clearer communication and boundaries in your living arrangements. It's crucial to address these issues directly rather than letting them build up, as they are impacting your sense of peace and comfort in your own home. Lastly, while supporting friends like Kaila is important, ensure that you maintain your own emotional boundaries so you don't become too entangled in their issues. Recognizing and addressing these areas can help alleviate some of the frustration you're experiencing.//
